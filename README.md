###  Tox Protocol Plugin For Pidgin / libpurple - discontinued

Sorry everyone, but I will not continue this project any further. I am using
one of the available Tox clients with audio and video support and since I
do not need the Pidgin tox plugin myself I won't spend any time on it.

I'll leave this repo around in case someone wants to fork and continue, but I
disabled issues and basically I won't be taking care of this code any more.
